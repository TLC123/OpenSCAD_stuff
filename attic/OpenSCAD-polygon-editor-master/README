WHAT IS IT?
===========
The OpenSCAD Polygon editor is a editor for OpenSCAD polygons (DUH).
OpenSCAD is a scripted CAD tool found at http://www.openscad.org/ it's great for many reasons. But it's all script which makes it hard to do some things.
The OpenSCAD Polygon editor (OsPed) helps you. You can just copy/paste your OpenSCAD code to OsPed and it will allow you to edit the polygons. Updating the copied code on the fly.
